## [Unreleased]

Branch: `scaffold` (initial scaffold, not yet pushed).

### Added

- Initial repository scaffold: Claude Code plugin marketplace
  (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) hosting the `senzing` plugin.
- `senzing` plugin built on the generate-and-run model over the hosted
  Senzing MCP server:
  - 6 skills: `analyze`, `build`, `demo`, `doctor`, `report`,
    `troubleshoot`.
  - 2 agents: `field-mapper`, `senzing-grounder`.
  - Hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`): `session_start.sh`,
    `check_provenance.sh`, and state-capture via `capture_state.sh`.
  - Hosted MCP server wiring in `plugins/senzing/.mcp.json`.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running the static check
  suite.
- `scripts/check.sh` static gate: JSON manifest parse, `bash -n` +
  shellcheck on hook scripts, SKILL/agent frontmatter validation, and
  `claude plugin validate --strict` on the marketplace and plugin.
- `evals/` placeholder with README.
- Dependabot config for the github-actions ecosystem (weekly, 21-day
  cooldown).
